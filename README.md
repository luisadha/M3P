# Mkshrc Mood Mod Project (M3P)

Nutshell,

This Mkshrc takes the source-code from mkshrc's 7175@xda-devoloper (on this page https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/shell-mksh-scripting-mksh-r50e-static-full-mkshrc_mods.2770804/) for Android
I added some code, fixes and features. I initially used this tool for myself in the end I decided to share it with everyone

I just share and hope it can be used and useful.

Nb: If you have any copyright related issues or anything like that, don't hesitate to contact me.
