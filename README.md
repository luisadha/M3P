# CUSTOM MKSHRC FOR OLD ANDROID PHONE'S

MKSHRC MOOD MOD PROJECTS from MKSHRC Mod (XDA)

## DECRIPTIONS

Various files for modification purposes `/system/etc/mkshrc' either replace or simply tag them with your own mkshrc that is placed on /sdcard. 

This Mkshrc is similar but not the same as the one on the xda thread because I'm patching it for personalization. 

Source of the xda.

## The version of the chart.
 
* fix all known errors or bugs from mkshrc mod by @7175 XDA and build the fpath root folder only. 
* Additional functions, alias, remove variable environment and cancel out problematic or unnecessary aliases.


## Features 

- Build a function environment that didn't exist before in mkshrc belonging to 7175 and add one sample function to it. 
- Auto load or motd like in Termux, but my version. Running without root access. 
- Fascinating dynamic prompt, SSH Connection status is activated by default. 
- Added ZSH Prompt to Linux Style, requires ZSH version 5.0.5 and xterm for your term settings. 
- Interactive Promt If you use an old version of mksh


# Prerequisites 
- Su's been granted permission to process the installation to the system. 
- a busy toolbox and a toy box.


## INTRUCTIONS

Change the file name from "Mkshrc Mood Mod Project" to "mkshrc", or download from the release and run the setups.sh script from the terminal emulator, select which options to take as patching or replacing, type `sh setups. sh --help' to see more options. 

### The magic 
I'm not going to lie. 

```
sh mountfix && sh setups.sh --help 

sh mountfix ``` [enter], new window additions and mkshrc have been modified successfully. 
I'm not going to lie.

### Non-Magisk
```
sh setups.sh --help
```


## Third party project advice
- bash (nanodroid/nanomod) or bash ccbins magical module
